#Next, implement the function getAvailableLetters that takes in one parameter - a list of letters, lettersGuessed. This function returns a string that is comprised of lowercase English letters - all lowercase English letters that are not in lettersGuessed.
#Example Usage:
#>>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
#>>> print(getAvailableLetters(lettersGuessed))
#abcdfghjlmnoqtuvwxyz
#Note that this function should return the letters in alphabetical order, as in the example above.
#For this function, you may assume that all the letters in lettersGuessed are lowercase.
